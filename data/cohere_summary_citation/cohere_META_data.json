The group, which previously consisted of seven leading technology companies, has now dwindled to the \"Magnificent Four.\" Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) continue to spearhead gains, while Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have underperformed compared to their peers. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre and Madison Mills discuss the details. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live. Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nAdTheCapitalReport.com\n\nTop AI Stocks Trending in 2024\n\nWhich A.I. stocks are better for investors right now?\n\nAI-powered stocks will face increasingly stiff competition: Analyst\n\nThe tech sector has been on a run with chip powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) leading the charge with an incredible 86% gain year-to-date. Many of the big names in tech \u2014 Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 have been grouped together and referred to as The Magnificent Seven, but some, like Apple and Tesla, have fallen off from great heights. Now, investors are chattering over whether or not tech can weather any potential storms in the market. TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Yahoo Finance to break down the recent movements in the tech sector and how its major players can operate moving forward. O'Donnell talks about potential leaders in tech for the long-term: \"The one thing is, Nvidia's got 90% share. Anybody who's got 90% share is going to lose a little share. But, that doesn't mean they still can't grow organically from where they are. You're just going to see a lot more competitors. If we look at it collectively, I still think there is several years of growth in the collective semiconductor market for AI-powered stuff. So, you're going to see, as I said, I talked about AMD (AMD). Intel (INTC) will be interesting to see.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.
