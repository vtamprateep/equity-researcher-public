X\n\nSleep apnea is a big market, estimated at about 50 million people in the U.S. On April 17, Eli Lilly said patients who took tirzepatide for a year had 55% to nearly 63% fewer sleep apnea events. The results outperformed a placebo group, and sent Lilly stock above its 50-day moving average, briefly. But the stock later retreated, and closed below that key mark.\n\nStill, the company remains bullish on its chances in obstructive sleep apnea. It's planning to ask global regulators to approve tirzepatide for this use in the middle of this year. Tirzepatide currently sells as a diabetes shot called Mounjaro and in weight loss as Zepbound. Its chief rival is Novo Nordisk (NVO), which sells semaglutide as Ozempic and Wegovy, respectively.\n\nLilly is also working on next-generation drugs, including a daily pill called orforglipron in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity. And its next-generation drug \u2014 which targets three hormones \u2014 could stoke even further weight loss. Bank of America Securities analyst Geoff Meacham expects tirzepatide to bring in $62 billion in 2030 and for the next-generation drugs to add $19 billion to that.\n\nBut others are coming and could rock Eli Lilly stock. Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) soared after its weight-loss drug topped Zepbound's Phase 3 results. Recently, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (MDGL) gained approval for the first-ever MASH treatment. MASH is a metabolic disease associated with obesity. Lilly is also testing tirzepatide in MASH treatment.\n\nEli Lilly is working to gain approval for its Alzheimer's treatment, a potential rival to Biogen (BIIB) and Eisai's (ESAIY) Leqembi. But the Food and Drug Administration said it would hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the drug's risks and benefits. Analysts noted the FDA will likely focus on brain swelling tied to drugs in this class.\n\nMeanwhile, Lilly locked up its acquisition of Point Biopharma, an expert in radioligand treatments for cancer. The company ties a radioisotope to a molecule capable of finding cancer cells in the body. This allows the drug to deliver targeted radiation directly to the tumor, limiting the impact on healthy tissue.\n\nSo, is Eli Lilly stock a buy right now?\n\nEli Lilly Stock: Bullish Sales Growth\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, Lilly earned an adjusted $2.49 per share on $9.35 billion in sales. Earnings popped 19% and beat expectations for $2.30 a share. Sales climbed 28% to top forecasts for $8.95 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nZepbound was on the market for just weeks in the December quarter. But sales climbed rapidly to $175.8 million. That was more than double the $75 million estimate from analysts polled by FactSet. Another forecast suggested Zepbound could come in with $125 million. Sales from Mounjaro grew nearly eightfold to $2.21 billion, handily beating forecasts.\n\nSales of breast cancer drug Verzenio rocketed 42% to $1.15 billion, but came in below projections for $1.17 billion. Diabetes treatment Jardiance brought in $798.1 million, topping expectations and soaring 30% year over year.\n\nBullish fourth-quarter sales lines up with savvy investing advice, which suggests investors look for companies with recent growth of at least 20% to 25%. But earnings didn't quite hit that bar in the most recent quarterly report.\n\nFor the first quarter, Eli Lilly stock analysts predict earnings of $2.47 per share, surging 52.5%, and for sales to grow 28.4% to $8.94 billion.\n\nLLY Stock: What Are Eli Lilly Yearly Earnings?\n\nIn 2023, Eli Lilly earned $6.32 a share, minus some items, on $34.12 billion in sales. Profit fell 20.4% but topped expectations for $6.23. Sales jumped 20% and came in above forecasts for $33.65 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nNotably, Mounjaro generated $5.16 billion in sales, jetting higher from $482.5 million in 2022 sales. Revenue from Verzenio and Jardiance came in at a respective $3.86 billion and $2.74 billion. Sales of Verzenio surged 56%, while Jardiance sales rocketed 33%.\n\nAfter the fourth-quarter report, Eli Lilly guided to $40.4 billion to $41.6 billion in 2024 sales. But Lilly expects demand for its GLP-1-based drugs will likely \"outpace supply\" this year. The company also calls for adjusted earnings of $12.20 to $12.70 per share. Both measures topped analysts' forecasts.\n\nWall Street expects Mounjaro to bring in $10.23 billion in sales this year, growing more than 98% year over year. Zepbound is projected to generate almost $3.5 billion in sales. In 2029, analysts expect the two drugs to bring in $23.81 billion and $16.36 billion in sales, respectively.\n\nLLY stock analysts also expect Alzheimer's drug donanemab to bring in $139 million in 2024 sales and reaching blockbuster status with $1.47 billion in 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, sales from blockbuster insulins Humalog and Humulin are expected to fall now that Lilly has announced price cuts. Sales of generics-facing Alimta, a cancer drug, are also forecast to drop.\n\nEli Lilly Stock Analysis\n\nEli Lilly stock is forming a flat base with a buy point at 800.78, according to MarketSurge.\n\nShares sank below their 50-day line this month and remained there in morning trades on April 25. Eli Lilly stock is still above its 200-day moving average, however.\n\nEli Lilly stock has a Relative Strength Rating of 93 out of a best-possible 99, IBD Digital shows. This puts shares in the top 7% of all stocks when it comes to 12-month performance. Shares have a Composite Rating of 89, a measure of fundamental and technical metrics.\n\nAlzheimer's Treatment News Hits LLY Stock\n\nEli Lilly is angling for FDA approval of donanemab, a potential Alzheimer's treatment that removes built-up plaque in the brain known as beta amyloid. Beta amyloid is a hallmark of the disease, though experts don't necessarily agree that it's the cause.\n\nThe FDA just said it plans to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the effectiveness and safety of donanemab in the study called Trailblazer-ALZ 2. The decision effectively pushes back the approval decision, which was expected before the end of this month.\n\nBiogen's Leqembi gained full approval for Alzheimer's treatment based on its ability to remove amyloid. In mid-July, Lilly said patients who received its drug for 18 months had a 22%-29% slower decline in cognition than placebo recipients.\n\nThe results were even stronger in patients with medium levels of a protein called tau in their brains. Donanemab led to a 35%-36% slower cognitive decline compared with a placebo.\n\nExperts noted that donanemab does a better job of clearing away beta amyloid than Biogen's Leqembi. But that could lead to higher levels of a side effect called amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA. This is generally asymptomatic swelling in the brain.\n\nEli Lilly Stock Investors Watch Weight-Loss Drugs\n\nInvestors in Eli Lilly stock are waiting for more from Lilly's efforts in obesity treatment. The FDA has signed off on its tirzepatide in patients with type 2 diabetes and as a weight-loss drug. Lilly also recently launched a direct-to-consumer website to help bolster sales of both.\n\nIn December, Lilly said patients who took Zepbound for eight months lost an average of 20.9% of their body weight. But when a group of patients switch to a placebo, they regained 14% of their weight over a year. Those who stayed on Zepbound lost an additional 5.5% of their weight.\n\nIn another analysis of electronic health records, patients who took tirzepatide for a year were three times more likely than recipients of Novo's semaglutide to lose at least 15% of their body weight. Novo sells semaglutide as diabetes treatments known as Ozempic and Rybelsus, and as a weight-loss drug called Wegovy. Semaglutide recipients were also 2.6 times and 1.8 times more likely to lose at least 10% and 5% of their weight, respectively.\n\nLilly's next-generation approach called retatrutide adds in a third target called the glucagon receptor, and could be an eventual boon for Eli Lilly stock. In theory, this could lead to improved weight loss. Over 24 weeks, overweight patients or those with obesity who received retatrutide lost up to 17.5% of their weight. At 48 weeks, patients lost up to 24.2% of their body weight.\n\nMounjaro had already set a high bar. Last June, Lilly said patients lost up to 15% of their body weight over 72 weeks. Lilly tested the drug in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity. In patients without diabetes, the drug generated even stronger weight loss, up to 22.5% of their body weight.\n\nLilly is also testing Mounjaro's ability to improve morbidity and mortality in patients with obesity or those who are overweight. The results of that study are expected in late 2027.\n\nIn August, Novo Nordisk said its obesity drug Wegovy cut the risk of cardiovascular events \u2014 like heart attack or stroke \u2014 in a five-year study. This could help make the case for insurance coverage of weight-loss drugs for patients who have or are at risk of cardiovascular disease. Later in the year, Novo said a weekly shot of Ozempic helped stave off renal impairment and reduced the risk of death due to kidney or cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.\n\nLilly just acquired Versanis Bio, which has a drug that could improve fat loss while limiting muscle mass loss associated with GLP-1 drugs. Further, Lilly entered into a collaboration with Verve Therapeutics (VERV) to test three potential gene-editing approaches to permanently lowering cholesterol.\n\nLess promisingly, on April 10, Lilly said patients who received its diabetes drug, Jardiance, after having a heart attack only had a 10% reduced risk of heart failure or death over 26 months. The results didn't meet statistical significance.\n\nIs LLY Stock A Buy Right Now?\n\nLilly stock isn't currently a buy. Shares recently fell below their 50-day line \u2014 a bearish sign \u2014 and are still forming a new flat base.\n\nLilly also reported strong sales and earnings growth. Sales were in line with savvy investing advice and both measures well above LLY stock analyst forecasts.\n\nIt will be key to watch how the markets for weight-loss drugs and Alzheimer's treatments unfold.\n\nTo find the best stocks to buy and watch, check out IBD Stock Lists.
