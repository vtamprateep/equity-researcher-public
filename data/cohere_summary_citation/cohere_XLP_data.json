However, with many economic headwinds to weather in 2024, questions arise around the status of consumer spending going forward. Apollo Global Management Chief Economist Torsten Slok joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the current economic environment and lay out the possible risks to the consumer spending. Slok explains that consumers are beginning to run out of excess savings dating back decreased spending from the pandemic, and the combination of mortgage rates and resuming of student loans could be a significant blow to consumer spending. \"At the same time, because of the Fed deciding to turn more dovish and the market interpreting that in a more dovish way, that is now becoming a bit more of a tailwind, so we don't anticipate that this will create a sharp slowdown,\" Slok says. \"But, it is very critical that excess savings running out will begin to give a path for consumption where we are going to see a slower growth rate over the next several quarters. That should be a softer landing for the US economy overall.\" Editor's note: Apollo Global Management owns a majority stake in Yahoo, the parent company of Yahoo Finance.
