The S&P 500 added 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.4%.\n\nThe central bank opted to hold rates steady, citing a \"lack of further progress\" in bringing inflation back down toward its 2% goal. However, stock prices rallied as Powell ruled out the likelihood of a hike in a press conference following the decision.\n\n\"I think it's unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike,\" he said. \"I'd say it's unlikely.\"\n\nInvestors also reacted positively to the Fed saying it would tap the brakes on one way it tightens conditions for financial markets. Starting in June, the central bank said it will slow the pace at which it allows maturing bond proceeds to roll off its balance sheet without reinvesting them. This is a process known as quantitative tightening.\n\n\"The fact that inflation remains elevated means we're not going to see rate cuts very soon,\" said Sonu Varghese, global macro strategist at Carson Group. \"At the same time, they are going to slow the pace at which they shrink their balance sheet (their massive bond portfolio), which will likely put less upward pressure on bond yields.\"\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield dropped below 4.6% following Powell's comments, alleviating some investor fears that it may jump back above 5% this year, and restrict the economy. Major technology stocks sensitive to the level of rates and risk appetite led the afternoon gains, with Microsoft and Alphabet gaining more than 2%. Amazon advanced 5% following better-than-expected earnings and revenue in the first quarter, while Meta Platforms jumped 4%.\n\nWall Street is coming off a losing month, with the S&P and the Nasdaq posting losses of more than 4%. The Dow fell 5% for its worst monthly performance since September 2022.\n\nStocks tied to artificial intelligence struggle during Wednesday's session, following disappointing reports from some top AI contenders. Advanced Micro Devices tumbled 7% after issuing an in-line current-quarter revenue forecast, while Super Micro Computer slid 11% on light revenue.\n\nRegional bank stocks surge 2.5% and are on pace to snap a 4-day decline\n\nRegional bank stocks rallied Wednesday, sending the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) 4% higher in late afternoon trading following the Federal Reserve's latest policy decision to leave interest rates unchanged and scale back its qualitative tightening program.\n\nThat's the first up day for regional bank stocks as a group in five days.\n\nThe largest percentage gains in regional banks came in New York Community Bancorp, up 31%, Axos Financial, higher by 14%, Capitol Federal Financial, ahead 9%, Bancorp Inc., which gained 6% and BankUnited Inc., better by 5.7%.\n\nSPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF over the past month.\n\nDollar index falls to session low\n\nThe dollar index declined 0.1% to 106.09 Wednesday afternoon following the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain its benchmark short-term borrowing rate in a range between 5.25% and 5%. The decision had been widely anticipated by the market.\n\nHowever, the dollar index was still above Tuesday's low of 105.667.\n\n\u2014 Hakyung Kim, Gina Francolla\n\nFederal Reserve keeps rates steady, moves to ease the pace of balance sheet reduction\n\nFederal Reserve Bank Chair Jerome Powell announces that interest rates will remain unchanged during a news conference at the bank's William McChesney Martin building on May 01, 2024 in Washington, DC.\n\nChip Somodevilla | Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates steady, deciding not to lower rates as it contends with persistent pricing pressures.\n\nThe central bank kept its benchmark short-term borrowing rate in a targeted range between 5.25% and 5% in what was a widely anticipated move. The federal funds rate has been at that level since July 2023.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee voted to ease the pace at which it is lowering bond holdings on the Fed's balance sheet, a move that could signal an incremental easing of monetary policy.\n\nThe S&P 500 was slightly lower following the decision.\n\n\u2014 Sarah Min, Jeff Cox\n\nRecent market sell-off is a 'normal pullback,' says Charles Schwab's Gordon\n\nThe recent market pullback is not anything out of the ordinary following a strong multimonth run in equities, according to Charles Schwab's Kevin Gordon.\n\n\"This is all part of a normal pullback after a strong rally since last October,\" said the director and senior investment strategist. \"Relative to prior pullbacks and prior bull markets, this looks pretty normal and pretty healthy.\"\n\nThe consolidation and rotation seen over the past month is also helping remove some \"frothy investor sentiment\" that has been a risk to the market in recent months, he added.\n\nGoldman Sachs' Peter Oppenheimer says diversification is key for investors\n\nPeter Oppenheimer, the chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, believes diversification will be key for investors this year.\n\nTo that end, he recommends investors barbell their portfolios with exposure to both quality growth and deep value stocks.\n\n\"There's some very cheap parts of the markets in value sectors which have been neglected for a very long time, but where you're starting to see some really strong compound cash returns for investors,\" Oppenheimer said on CNBC's \"Money Movers\" on Wednesday. He added that this was especially true in the energy and financials sectors, particularly for European banks.\n\nQuality growth names consist of companies with strong balance sheets, therefore making them less sensitive to rising rates.\n\nLikewise, Oppenheimer also believes investors should broaden their portfolios to ex-U.S. opportunities this year.\n\n\"That doesn't mean to be underweight of the U.S., but to have more broad global exposure because some of the more value orientated markets like Europe, like Japan, are actually holding up or even outperforming relative to the U.S. because they're a lot cheaper and therefore less exposed to the risks of rising rates,\" the strategist added.\n\nViking shares pop more than 10% after cruise line operator's NYSE debut\n\nShares of luxury cruise line operator Viking popped 10.3% after the company's initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.\n\nViking started trading at $24 per share under the ticker \"VIK,\" and was last at $26.55 a share during early afternoon trading Wednesday. The company was targeting a $10.4 billion valuation in its IPO, making it the third-largest cruise operator after Royal Caribbean and Carnival.\n\nViking upsized its IPO after existing shareholders decided to sell an additional nine million shares due to strong demand from mutual fund investors, according to a source familiar with the situation, CNBC reported.\n\n\u2014 Pia Singh, Seema Mody\n\nThe Dow bucked the other two major indexes' downtrend on Wednesday.\n\nThe blue-chip average added about 0.3% in midday trading. Meanwhile, the broad S&P 500 and technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively.\n\nJohnson & Johnson and 3M led the Dow higher by percent change, climbing more than 4% and 2%, respectively. Boeing and Honeywell were the next-biggest gainers, with each adding about 1.4%.\n\nThose jumps overshadowed slides seen elsewhere. Nike was the worst performer in the average with a drop of nearly 2%, followed by Chevron's loss of almost 1%.\n\nDespite Wednesday's outperformance, the Dow has seen the smallest gain of the three major averages compared with the start of 2024.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, Starbucks, Pfizer among stocks making biggest midday moves\n\nThe logos of Super Micro Computer are pictured at one of the world's largest computer and technology trade shows.\n\nCheck out the companies making headlines in midday trading:\n\nSuper Micro Computer \u2014 The server vendor dropped 15% after missing revenue expectations for its fiscal third quarter. However, Super Micro beat analysts' expectations for its adjusted earnings and hiked its revenue guidance for its fiscal 2024 year.\n\nStarbucks \u2014 Shares plunged more than 16% after the coffee chain posted weaker-than-expected quarterly results on the top and bottom lines. Starbucks posted adjusted earnings of 68 cents per share on revenue of $8.56 billion. It missed analysts' forecasts of 79 cents per share in earnings and $9.13 billion in revenue, per LSEG.\n\nNew York Community Bank \u2014 Shares of the beaten-down regional bank popped more than 31% after CEO Joseph Otting said in a release, \"we have a clear path to profitability over the following two years.\"\n\nFor the full list, read here.\n\nShort interest in 'Magnificent 7' stocks climbed to record $127 billion in April, S3 Partners says\n\nShort interest in the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks climbed to a record $127 billion in April, S3 Partners managing director of predictive analytics Ihor Dusaniwsky said in a report Wednesday.\n\nBets against the seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Nvidia and Tesla) \"will always be high,\" since they represent \"an easy and cheap way to hedge the tech aspect of a portfolio. But the momentum of the market, especially the tech side, does dictate the majority of the variances of short interest on these seven companies,\" Dusaniwsky said, noting that short interest on the seven averaged $86 billion a month over the past five years but fell as low as $57 billion in 2022.\n\nSo far in 2024, investors have made an estimated $5.6 billion shorting Tesla and $2.4 billion going against Apple, according to S3 mark-to-market data. But they have lost $9.8 billion betting the other way against Nvidia, are down $2.3 billion on Meta and off $2.1 billion on Amazon.\n\nGiven the past week's rebound in the market, S3 has mostly observed short covering in the group, where investors buy back stock to limit their losses. \"We have seen some squeeze related short covering in NVDA which was partially offset with increased short selling in MSFT, AAPL and META,\" S3 said.\n\nS&P 500 has seen 300 trading days since last dropping more than 2%\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on April 29, 2024.\n\nMichael M. Santiago | Getty Images\n\nThere have been 300 sessions since the S&P 500 last tumbled more than 2% in one day, according to Strategas.\n\nThat stretch of \"subdued volatility,\" as the firm calls it, is nearing levels last seen in 2017, when the broad index went more than 350 sessions without a slide that big. These periods are typically associated with above-average returns, Strategas' Ryan Grabinski told clients in a note.\n\nStill, he said it is a matter of when \u2014 and not if \u2014 volatility comes back. \"The real question is what exactly will the catalyst be for that to happen?\" Grabinski said in his Wednesday note.\n\nJob openings fell in April to lowest in more than 3 years\n\nJob openings declined by 325,000 in March, signaling that while hiring is still brisk, demand is decreasing.\n\nThe Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey released Wednesday shows postings declined to a seasonally adjusted 8.49 million, which represented a 0.2 percentage point decrease to 5.1% as a share of total workers. Openings declined more than 1.1 million from a year ago.\n\nThat was the lowest level since February 2021 and took the ratio of openings to available workers down to 1.3 to 1, below its 2 to 1 peak in early 2022. Hires and separations also decreased on the month.\n\nFed Chair Powell's postmeeting comments could take a 'hawkish shift,' Wolfe Research says\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on interest rate policy in Washington on March 20, 2024.\n\nElizabeth Frantz | Reuters\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell could take a more hawkish tone in Wednesday's press conference following the central bank's policy meeting, according to Wolfe Research. That would be in line with Powell's more recent comments on inflation after data pointed to persistent pricing pressures.\n\nBut the Wall Street firm anticipates that growth and employment will likely have more of an effect on stocks in the intermediate term, the firm's Chris Senyek wrote Wednesday. Wednesday's Fed meeting precedes the April jobs report that is due out Friday.\n\n\"We expect the FOMC's statement at 2pm ET and Fed Chair Powell's press conference tone to reflect the committee's hawkish shift two weeks ago,\" Senyek wrote. \"That said, looking out over the intermediate-term, we believe that the growth & employment outlook is likely to have a bigger influence on FOMC's decision making and overall equity market returns.\"\n\nISM manufacturing index declines while prices measure spikes\n\nThe manufacturing sector returned to a contraction in April, according to a report Wednesday from the Institute for Supply Management that also showed accelerating inflation pressures.\n\nThe ISM Manufacturing Index declined to 49.2 for the month, off 1.1 points from March, which was the first time the measure moved above the 50 level that indicates expansion since September 2022. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a reading of 50.1.\n\nWithin the survey, the prices index rose to 60.9, a 5.1-point increase and another indication that inflation is proving more intractable than economists and policymakers had been expecting.\n\nCVS Health heads for worst day since 2009\n\nPeople exit the CVS Pharmacy store in Times Square in New York City on March 1, 2024.\n\nEduardo Munoz Alvarez | View Press | Corbis News | Getty Images\n\nCVS Health sank more than 18% on Wednesday and headed for its worst day in nearly 15 years on the back of a disappointing quarter.\n\nThe slump came after the drugstore giant's quarterly results fell short of Wall Street's estimates. CVS also slashed its full-year outlook due to elevated medical costs.\n\nIf shares close at these levels, CVS will register its worst daily performance since Nov. 5, 2009, when shares tumbled more than 20%. It would also mark the company's third-worst trading day on record.\n\nS&P 500, Nasdaq open lower\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite opened lower Wednesday as Wall Street braced for the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate decision.\n\nThe broad market index slipped 0.15%, along with the Nasdaq. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 46 points, or 0.1%\n\nStocks making the biggest moves premarket\n\nA Marriott hotel in Austin, Texas, on Feb. 12, 2023.\n\nSergio Flores | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nHere are some of the companies making headlines in premarket trading:\n\nPfizer \u2014 Shares climbed more than 2% after New York City-based Pfizer beat Wall Street's first-quarter revenue forecast and raised its full-year profit guidance.\n\nCVS Health \u2014 Shares tumbled 12% after the drugstore chain and pharmacy benefit manager's first-quarter adjusted earnings and revenue fell short of estimates and it cut its full-year profit outlook, citing higher medical costs.\n\nMarriott International \u2014 The hotel chain slipped about 2% on the heels of weak earnings and current-quarter guidance. Marriott earned $2.13 per share, excluding items, in the first quarter, missing the consensus forecast of $2.17 from analysts polled by LSEG.\n\nRead the full list here.\n\nPrivate payrolls add 192,000 workers in April\n\nPrivate payrolls added 192,000 workers in April, according to the latest data from payrolls processing firm ADP.\n\nThe figure came in ahead of the 183,000 additions expected by Dow Jones, but below the 208,000 upward revision for March.\n\n\u2014 Jeff Cox, Samantha Subin\n\nAMD drops 7% after providing in-line forecast\n\nPau Barrena | Afp | Getty Images\n\nAMD shares dropped nearly 7% in premarket trading after the chipmaker provided only an in-line forecast for the current quarter.\n\nThe company reported first-quarter sales that were slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations, while AMD expects $4 billion in 2024 artificial intelligence chip sales, up from a $3.5 billion forecast in January.\n\nHowever, since the popular chip stock has already risen 14% in 2024, Tuesday's results were not enough to prevent the stock from sliding.\n\nCVS slides more than 10% after earnings miss\n\nA sign outside of a CVS Pharmacy store in Miami, Florida, on Feb. 7, 2024.\n\nJoe Raedle | Getty Images\n\nShares of CVS Health fell sharply in premarket trading after a first-quarter report missed Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines.\n\nThe pharmacy and health-care company reported $1.31 in adjusted earnings per share on $88.44 billion in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting $1.69 in earnings per share on $89.21 billion in revenue.\n\nThe company also cut its full-year guidance for earnings per share and cash flow.\n\nCVS' health-care benefits segment struggled, with its adjusted operating income falling nearly 60% year over year despite an increase in revenue.
