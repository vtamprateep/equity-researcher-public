So is JPM stock worth buying right now? X\n\nThe CPI inflation rate came in at 8.5%. That was down from June's 9.1%, as gas prices and shipping rates fell, and retailers began to cut prices to clear goods like clothing.\n\nThe bank's second-quarter results, reported last month, missed estimates. CEO Jamie Dimon warned that rising prices and higher interest rates could hurt what was still a strong U.S. economy.\n\n\"The U.S. economy continues to grow and both the job market and consumer spending, and their ability to spend, remain healthy,\" Dimon said in a statement.\n\n\"But geopolitical tension, high inflation, waning consumer confidence, the uncertainty about how high rates have to go and the never-before-seen quantitative tightening and their effects on global liquidity, combined with the war in Ukraine and its harmful effect on global energy and food prices are very likely to have negative consequences on the global economy sometime down the road,\" he continued.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has raised interest rates in an effort to head off rising prices, with the hopes that higher borrowing costs will keep the economy from overheating. Higher rates from the Fed can lift banks' bottom lines, as those rate hikes prompt banks to hike interest on things like credit cards and auto loans. But the Fed risks damaging the economy if consumers can't stomach rising borrowing costs.\n\nJPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by market value. But despite the bank's reputation, JPMorgan stock has largely trailed the S&P 500 since 1986. Here's a breakdown of the JPM stock chart and financials.\n\nIBD 50 Growth Stocks To Watch: Find The Best Stocks To Buy And Track\n\nJPM Stock Fundamental Analysis\n\nJPMorgan stock has a 29 Composite Rating, on a 1-99 scale, with 99 tops. Its EPS Rating stands at 65.\n\nIBD encourages investors to focus on stocks with Composite Ratings of 90 or higher.\n\nThe stock's SMR Rating is a B, with 'A' the highest possible rating.\n\nJPMorgan Stock Technical Analysis\n\nJPM stock is currently trading at around 118.\n\nThe stock and its relative strength line have rebounded in recent days. Longer term, the RS line shows that JPM stock has largely moved in line with the market going back to 1998, or even 1986.\n\nThat's also a problem for banking giants such as Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC). While bank stocks benefit in tandem with the economy, if the economy is doing well, so will the stock market generally.\n\nLong-term outperformance has been ephemeral for JPM stock, even though it has generally outperformed its big peers.\n\nPut another way, if you bought the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) back in 1998, you'd have the same or better returns with far less risk.\n\nJPMorgan stock and its rivals can have periods of outperformance, as they did near the end of 2019. JPM stock, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and others outperformed the market from April 2016 to March 2017, with most of those gains following former President Trump's surprise election victory.\n\nIBD Stock Of The Day: See How To Find, Track And Buy The Best Stocks\n\nJPMorgan has a market value of around $348 billion, according to MarketSmith. Its business is a one-stop financial shop for Wall Street and Main Street. But the stock is not in a base.\n\nBottom line: JPM stock is not a buy right now, based on IBD's chart analysis.\n\nLike other big banks, JPMorgan also has a poor record when it comes to beating the market for long stretches.\n\nCheck out IBD Stock Lists and other IBD content to find dozens of the best stocks to buy or watch.\n\nFollow Bill Peters on Twitter at @IBD_BPeters.\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:\n\nBanks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And Analysis\n\nInverted Yield Curve Sparks Recession Fears; What You Need To Know\n\nInvesting in Stocks 101: The Beginning Investor's Guide To Making More Money\n\nMarketSmith Provides Investors With Cool Tools\n\nS&P 500 Index: Track S&P News, Stocks To Watch And SPDR ETFs\n\n1/29/2024 What is the latest performance of the S&P 500 index?
