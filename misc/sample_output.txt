But realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products.\"\n\nLi said Meta also continues to expect its Reality Labs division to report increased year-over-year operating losses as the company builds out its various AI, AR, and VR efforts.\n\n\"While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,\" Li said in a release.\n\nMeta reported earnings per share of $4.71 in the quarter on revenue of $36.46 billion. Wall Street was anticipating EPS of $4.30 on revenue of $36.12 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMeta stock had been on a tear, climbing 131% over the last 12 months and more than 39% year to date. That\u2019s far better than chief rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL) which is up 50% in the last 12 months and 13% year to date.\n\nWhile part of Meta\u2019s stock performance has to do with a recovery in the digital advertising market, the company\u2019s stock price also rocketed higher last quarter after the social media company announced it was initiating a $0.50 per share dividend and increased its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion.\n\nThe company did not announce any updates to its shareholder return initiatives on Wednesday.\n\nMeta has made a series of announcements regarding its AI efforts in recent months, including debuting its Meta AI chatbot and Llama 3 large language model on April 18.\n\nThe chatbot, however, has already garnered controversy after it joined a private Facebook group for mothers in Manhattan and claimed to have a child of its own, 404 Media reported.\n\nOn the metaverse front, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Monday that Meta will make its Horizon operating system for headsets open source, allowing third-party companies like Lenovo and Microsoft to use it to build their own devices using the software. The idea is to bring more headsets to market while increasing Meta's reach in the AR/VR space.\n\nThe company also stands to benefit significantly if Congress's TikTok ban, which President Biden signed into law on Wednesday, survives legal challenges. If the app is locked out of the US, it stands to reason that users and creators would turn to rival platforms like Instagram to scratch their social media itches.\n\nSubscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

Net income more than doubled to $12.37 billion, or $4.71 per share, from $5.71 billion, or $2.20 per share, a year ago.\n\nOne reason for the pop in net income is that, while revenue growth accelerated, sales and marketing costs dropped 16% from the year-earlier period.\n\nMeta said it expects sales in the second quarter of $36.5 billion to $39 billion. The midpoint of the range, $37.75 billion, would represent 18% year-over-year growth and is below analysts' average estimate of $38.3 billion.\n\nThe stock sell-off accelerated early in the earnings call after CEO Mark Zuckerberg jumped into his discussion about investments, namely in areas like glasses and mixed reality, where the company doesn't currently make money. And he said investments in artificial intelligence are increasing.\n\n\"On the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nThe Facebook parent no longer reports daily active users and monthly active users. It now gives a figure for what it calls \"family daily active people.\" That number was 3.24 billion for March 2024, a 7% increase from a year earlier.\n\nMeta has raised investor expectations due to its improved financial performance in recent quarters, leaving little room for error. The stock is up about 40% this year after almost tripling last year. In February 2023, Zuckerberg told investors it would be the \"year of efficiency,\" which initiated the rally.\n\nAt the time, Zuckerberg said the company would be better at eliminating unnecessary projects and cracking down on bloat, which would help Meta become a \"stronger and more nimble organization.\" The company cut about 21,000 jobs in the first half of 2023, and Zuckerberg said in February of this year that hiring will be \"relatively minimal compared to what we would have done historically.\"\n\nHeadcount declined by 10% in the first quarter from a year earlier to 69,329.\n\nCapital expenditures for 2024 are anticipated to be in the $35 billion to $40 billion range, an increase from a prior forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion \"as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap,\" Meta said.\n\nAverage revenue per user in the quarter was $11.20, it said.\n\nThe company has been clawing back digital ad market share after a dismal 2022. At that time, it was reeling from Apple's iOS privacy update and macroeconomic concerns that led many brands to rein in spending.\n\nZuckerberg spearheaded an initiative to rebuild the ad business with a focus on AI. On the company's last earnings call in February, finance chief Susan Li said Meta has been investing in AI models that can accurately predict relevant ads for users, as well as tools that automate the ads-creation process.\n\nAdvertising revenue, which accounts for the vast majority of Meta's business, jumped 27% to $35.64 billion.\n\nMeta is benefiting from a stabilizing economy and surge in spending from Chinese discount retailers like Temu and Shein, which have been pumping money into Facebook and Instagram in an effort to reach a wider swath of users. Some analysts have warned that slower spending from China-based advertisers could be a source of concern in the first quarter and as the year progresses.\n\nMeta CFO Susan Li said on the earnings call that the company isn't quantifying the contribution from China in the quarter, but she said advertising revenue in the Asia-Pacific region increased 41% from a year earlier, making it the fastest growing region, and was boosted by online commerce and gaming.\n\nThe company's Reality Labs unit, which houses the company's hardware and software for development of the nascent metaverse, continues to bleed cash. Reality Labs reported sales of $440 million for the quarter and $3.85 billion in losses, bringing total losses since the end of 2020 to over $45 billion.\n\nAnalysts expected the division to show an operating loss of $4.31 billion for the quarter.\n\nDon\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\nHere are Wednesday's biggest analyst calls: Tesla, Amazon, Airbnb, Domino's, Walmart, Disney & more\n\nForget Nvidia: Morgan Stanley says Intel's much-hyped AI chip will boost 3 global stocks\n\nAnalysts love this gold explorer's stock \u2014 and even the most cautious expect it to soar 114%\n\nBank of America upgrades Tesla, says first-quarter report opens door for strong gains ahead\n\nThis biotech stock specializing in targeted cancer treatments can surge 50%, Jefferies says\n\nHere's where to invest $1 million right now, according to the pros\n\nWATCH: Meta will generate more ad dollars than the competition\n\nMeta will generate more ad dollars than its competition, says Jefferies Brent Thill", "timestamp": "2024-04-29T11:47:38", "title": "Meta plunges 16% on weak revenue guidance even as first-quarter results top estimates", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/24/meta-meta-q1-2024-earnings-.html"}, {"id": "web-search_4", "snippet": "IBD Digital: 2 Months for $20\n\nPsychological Indicators\n\nStocks Near A Buy Zone\n\nRelative Strength at New High\n\nRising Profit Estimates\n\nIBD Digital: 2 Months for $20\n\nIBD Long-Term Leaders\n\nStocks Funds Are Buying\n\nInvesting Action Plan\n\nIBD 50 Stocks To Watch\n\nIBD Digital: 2 Months for $20\n\nPremium Investing Tools\n\nMagnificent Seven Stocks\n\nIBD Digital: 2 Months for $20\n\nInvesting With IBD Podcast\n\nHow To Invest Videos\n\nGrowth Stories Podcast\n\nIBD Digital: 2 Months for $20\n\nHow To Invest In Stocks\n\n3 Keys To Stock Investing\n\nTracking Stock Market Trends\n\nHow To Read Stock Charts\n\nPremium Online Courses\n\nEducational Resources\n\nInvesting Strategies Video Series\n\nInvesting With IBD Podcast\n\nInvesting Infographics\n\nIBD Digital: 2 Months for $20\n\nOIL STOCKS: Energy Giants In Turf War Over This Hotspot\n\nYour cart is currently empty.

'AI Fever Claims Yet Another Victim.'\n\n04:01 PM ET 04/25/2024\n\nMeta Platforms (META) late Wednesday posted first-quarter earnings results that topped expectations, with 27% year-over-year revenue growth. But Meta stock fell sharply as the company gave lower than expected revenue guidance and raised its expectations for spending, citing its artificial intelligence push. X\n\nOne analyst called Meta a victim of \"AI fever.\" Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg defended the company's plan to \"invest significantly more over the coming years\" to advance its AI ambitions. But the report triggered a sell-off. On the stock market today, Meta stock plunged more than 10.5% to close at 441.38. The slide pushed Meta stock to its lowest level since late January.\n\nThe harsh response comes despite Meta clearing a high bar for its first-quarter results. The company said in a news release that it earned $4.71 per share on sales of $36.46 billion for the March-ended quarter. On average, analysts projected Meta would post earnings of $4.32 per share on sales of $36.14 billion, according to FactSet. Sales jumped 27% year over year while earnings increased 114%.\n\nMeta Guidance For Q2 2024\n\nMeta's guidance for the current quarter missed the mark, however. Meta guided for sales between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, or $37.75 billion at the midpoint of its range. That was short of the $38.25 billion in sales for the June-ending quarter that analysts were projecting, according to FactSet.\n\nThe midpoint of its range would represent roughly 18% year over year revenue growth for Meta's second quarter, compared to sales growth of 27%, 24.7% and 23.2% in Meta's three previous quarters. But analysts anticipated that Meta's growth rate would slow this year, as the company came up against harder year-over-year comparisons.\n\nBut rising costs may have caught some investors off guard.\n\nMeta now projects capital expenditures between $35 billion and $40 billion this year, increased from the company's prior range of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta expects overall expenses for the year to fall between $96 billion and $99 billion, up from a previous given range of $94 billion to $99 billion.\n\nOn a call with analysts Wednesday, Zuckerberg highlighted that the company released updates to its Meta.ai chatbot and Llama large language model last week.\n\n\"I view the results our teams have achieved here as another key milestone in showing that we have the talent, data and ability to scale infrastructure to build the world's leading AI models and services,\" Zuckerberg said. \"And this leads me to believe that we should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world.\"\n\nBrian White, an analyst with Monness Crespi Hardt, described the market response to Meta in client note titled \"AI Fever Claims Yet Another Victim.\" He maintained a buy rating and price target of 540. But he cautioned about the challenges ahead for the company.\n\n\"Meta's AI ambitions are driving increased spending and we expect more AI casualties,\" White wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. \"We believe Meta is well positioned to benefit from the digital ad trend, innovate with AI, leverage a leaner cost structure, and capitalize on the potential demise of TikTok; however, regulatory scrutiny persists and we believe the darkest days of this economic quagmire are ahead of us.\n\nFutures Fall; Meta Dives, Leads 5 Key Earnings Movers\n\nMeanwhile, a strong quarter for Meta's advertising business was overshadowed by the AI spending concerns.\n\nAd pricing was up 6% year over year, compared to 2% growth in the previous quarter. The company again had strong growth from ad-buyers in the Asia-Pacific region, where spending increased 41% year over year. Meta has benefited from e-commerce businesses in China \u2014 such as Temu \u2014 buying ads to reach shoppers in other markets. But Meta CFO Susan Li cautioned that Meta will now be \"lapping periods of increasingly strong demand\" from Chinese advertisers.\n\nStill, Meta's strong ad performance does not seem to be helping other social media stocks. Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP) is down nearly 5% in premarket trading. Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest (PINS) were lower in early trading as well. They could be hit by concerns about Meta's guidance. Snap reports earnings later Thursday, while Reddit and Pinterest are scheduled for next week.\n\nBernstein analyst Mark Shmulik maintained a buy rating for Meta following the report. But he lowered his price target to 565, from 590. Still, he highlighted that Meta is back to \"attacking\" markets after a 2022 slide that put it on the defensive last year.\n\n\"Meta's handled every challenge that's come their way \u2014 TikTok, privacy, cash burn \u2014 and come out the other side stronger, leaner, and prouder,\" Shmulik wrote. \"There's a difference between defense and offense, where expectations are higher and uncertain. But offensive is more fun, isn't it? We're buyers.\"\n\nTech Futures Jump On Google, Microsoft; Rally Attempt Shows Resilience\n\nMeta Stock: Technical Ratings\n\nMeta stock's slide will put a big dent in its strong run. Prior to its slide late Wednesday, Meta stock trailed only Nvidia (NVDA) for the best performance in 2024 among the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that helped power the stock market rally in 2023.\n\nComing into the report, Meta stock had a perfect IBD Composite Rating of 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nFurther, Meta's IBD Relative Strength Rating was 96 out of 99.\n\nMeta stock is on several IBD stock lists, including Tech Leaders, IBD 50, Big Cap 20 and the premium IBD Leaderboard list.\n\nIs Amazon Stock A Buy Right Now?\n\nTop Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch\n\nLearn How To Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nFind The Best Long-Term Investments With IBD Long-Term Leaders\n\nMagnificent Seven Stocks: Latest News & Market Cap Weighting\n\nCloud Computing: Find Top Cloud Stocks And Track Industry Trends\n\n4/29/2024 As demand for cloud computing continues to rise with the explosion of smartphones, artificial intelligence and always-connected devices, leading cloud...\n\n4/29/2024 As demand for cloud computing continues to rise with the...\n\nHow To Trade Stocks: This Type Of Chart Pattern Took Facebook Stock On 47% Run\n\nStock Market Surge Prompts This Bullish Change; Fed Meeting, Key AI Stock Earnings Loom\n\nMeta Returns To Spending Mode.

Intel (INTC.O), opens new tab, which has missed out on the AI-led rally, was up 0.7% ahead of earnings.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who floored Wall Street last year with his cost-cutting drive, said on a post-earnings call that costs would grow \"meaningfully\" over the coming years before the company makes \"much revenue\" from some of its AI products.\n\nThat stoked investor fears that Zuckerberg was plunging Meta into another costly endeavor at a time when its augmented and virtual reality business was losing billions of dollars each quarter.\n\n\"Investors were caught off guard by higher capital expenditure, exacerbated by slightly softer second-quarter revenue guide. As such, shares are entering the 'penalty box,'\" Baird Equity Research analysts said.\n\nMeta forecast April-June revenue below estimates and raised the bottom end of its 2024 total expense forecast by $2 billion on Wednesday. It also raised the top end of its capital expenditure view as it invests in data centers essential to its efforts to catch up with AI frontrunners OpenAI and Microsoft.\n\nReuters Graphics Reuters Graphics\n\nThe dour expectations follow a series of smash-hit earnings that helped Meta nearly triple its stock in 2023 and powered the biggest one-day market value gain by any company in Wall Street history, of $196 billion, in February after its maiden dividend.\n\nStill, several analysts were positive on the investments, pointing to AI-driven engagement on content such as Instagram Reels and the warm reception for its virtual assistant Meta AI and early versions of its latest large language model, Llama 3.\n\n\"We think this time it is different,\" Evercore ISI analysts said. \"This investment cycle comes from a position of strength, as management continues to see a healthy ad demand environment into Q2 and improving user engagement.\"\n\nOverall, 19 analysts lowered their price targets on the stock, while 13 raised their view, according to LSEG data.
